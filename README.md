# FluidSim

## About 

**This project is currently under construction.**

FluidSim is a particle-based fluid simulation designed to demonstrate the concepts of fluid dynamics and collision detection in a 2D environment. It uses QuadTrees for optimised collision detection, reducing the computational complexity of the simulation.

## Features

- Uses ```pygame``` for visualisations.
- Real-time 2D fluid simulation.
- Optimised collision detection using QuadTree data structure to minimize the number of collision checks.
- Dynamic particle generation with varying velocities and sizes.
- Adjustable parameters to control simulation behavior and visual aspects.
